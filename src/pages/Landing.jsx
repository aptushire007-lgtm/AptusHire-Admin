 * Replaces: Narrative Workflow — six stacked text cards of equal weight, which
 * carried the right argument in the most monotonous form available. Each stage
 * now pairs with the artifact it actually produces, because a product whose
 * claim is "look at the evidence" should show the evidence rather than describe
 * it in a sixth consecutive paragraph.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT carried over from the supplied reference: the dark neural
 * backdrop and glow wave (DESIGN.md § Don't — looking futuristic undermines the
 * claim that a code path computed the score), the borrowed logo wall (gate 46 —
 * fabricated endorsement), and the three equal icon-above-heading-above-body
 * cards (a named critical tell in its own right). The reference's *structure* —
 * visual anchor, 3-up strip, visual-per-step — is what was worth taking.
 *
 * Motion is down from four revealed sections to one: the diptych halves
 * cross-fade in staggered, per the Split Studio reveal spec. Everything else on
 * the page is simply there.
