// Focus rings are one step darker than a "tint" would suggest, across every
// variant. A ring is only an affordance if it is visible against the surface
// BEHIND the control, and the surface is bone (#f6f2ea): tint-weight rings
// measured 1.4–1.9:1 against it, i.e. the loudest treatment in the system had
// quietly become the faintest. Each value below clears the 3:1 floor WCAG 2.2
// sets for a focus indicator — brand-300 3.37:1, slate-400 3.04:1, red-500
// 3.37:1, accent-500 3.33:1.
//
// Every FILLED variant disables to the same greige, and that uniformity is the
// point. Each used to disable into its own ramp's 300, which worked while those
// were tints and broke the moment brand-300 became the (necessarily dark) petrol
// focus step: a disabled primary rendered as a solid mid-teal block that read as
// a live button — louder than the real secondary beside it. A disabled control
// must not be able to out-shout an enabled one, so the disabled surface is
// neutral and shared, and the label goes muted with it rather than staying
// white. slate-500 on slate-200 is 4.14:1: unmistakably inert, still readable.
